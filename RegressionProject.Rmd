This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
require(ggplot2, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
require(dplyr, quietly = TRUE, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
data(mtcars)
amdata = filter(mtcars, am == 1)
smdata = filter(mtcars, am == 0)
fit = lm(mpg ~ factor(am), data = mtcars)
fitsm = lm(mpg ~ gear + carb + wt, data = smdata)
fitam = lm(mpg ~ gear + carb + wt, data = amdata)
str(fit)
str(fit$coefficients)
fit$coefficients
 g = ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(am), mpg))
 g = g + geom_abline(intercept = fit$coefficients[1], slope = fit$coefficients[2])
 g = g + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
g = g + geom_boxplot()
 g

fitsm$coefficients
fitam$coefficients


plotCovariant <- function (g, ylable) {
  #g = ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = var))
g = g + xlab("Miles Per gallon")
g = g + ylab(ylable)
g = g + geom_point(data = amdata, size = 2, colour = "red")
g = g + geom_point(data = smdata, size = 2, colour = "blue")
g = g + geom_smooth(data = amdata, method = "lm", colour = "red")
g = g + geom_smooth(data = smdata, method = "lm", colour = "blue")
g = g + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(amdata$mpg), colour = "red", linetype = "longdash")
g = g + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(smdata$mpg), colour = "blue", linetype = "longdash")
g
  
}

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE }
plotCovariant(ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = cyl)), "Cylinders")
plotCovariant(ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp)), "Displacement")
plotCovariant(ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = carb)), "Carburator Barrels" )
plotCovariant(ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = gear)), "Number of Gears" )
plotCovariant(ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)), "Weight" )
plotCovariant(ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)), "Horse Power" )



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
